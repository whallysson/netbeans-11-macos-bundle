# NetBeans MacOS Bundle Version 11
I put this small project together, to be a quick and temporary way to install NetBeans on a Mac.

First off, you should either clone or download this project if you want to use the original install script.

To run it, use the install.sh script. The user is prompted for the password because the script includes "sudo's" to gain permission to the /Applications folder.

### Installation
Open the terminal:
````
cd Downloads
git clone https://github.com/whallysson/netbeans-11-macos-bundle.git
cd netbeans-11-macos-bundle/
./install.sh
````

When the download finishes, it asks for the root password to finish the installation.

Now it's only in your applications and Netbeans 11 will be there. =)
